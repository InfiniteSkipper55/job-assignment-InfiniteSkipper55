# Notes

## Improvement Ideas
1. **State Management Enhancements**: Implementing additional properties like `priority` and `duration` can provide more granular control over state transitions.
2. **Streaming Data**: Using WebSockets or MQTT for real-time data streaming from robots to the application.
3. **Error Handling**: Introducing a robust logging mechanism and alerting system for critical errors and anomalies.
4. **Aggregation**: Implementing aggregation methods for summarizing state counts and statuses over time.

## Data Streaming
Using WebSockets or MQTT can ensure efficient, real-time communication between the robots and the state management system. This will help in monitoring and responding to state changes promptly.

## Error Communication
A dedicated error handling service that logs errors and notifies the relevant personnel or systems can enhance the robustness of the application. Using tools like Sentry or custom solutions can be beneficial.

## Additional Properties
- `priority`: Integer field to determine the execution priority of states.
- `duration`: Time duration for which the state is active.

## Aggregation Method
To aggregate state counts and statuses efficiently:
1. Use MongoDB's aggregation framework.
2. Create indexes on `createdAt` and `status` fields for faster querying.
3. Summarize data on an hourly, daily, and monthly basis using appropriate MongoDB aggregation stages.

## API Documentation
Swagger or Postman can be used to document the API endpoints. This will provide an easy way to test and understand the API functionalities.
